# AMS 595 Project 4: Mandelbrot Fractal, Markov Chains, and Taylor Approximation

## Introduction

There are 3 sections to this project. First, we compute the Mandelbrot set over the range [-2,1] x [-1.5,1.5] and construct an image of the Mandelbrot fractal. In the second part, we work with Markov chains and create a script that works with 5 states. In the third part, we write a script that can approximate any function using Taylor series approximation and measure the elapsed time as well as the absolute error for different polynomial degrees. 

## Computing the Mandelbrot Fractal

In this section, we write a Python script which computes the Mandelbrot set over the range [-2,1] x [-1.5,1.5], using a threshold of 50. Given the following iteration:

$$
z_{n+1} = z_n^2 + c, \quad z_i,\, c \in \mathbb{C}
$$

consider that $z_0 = 0$. This iteration will be bounded or diverge to infinity, based on the value that is chosen for $c$. A complex number $c$ is part of the Mandelbrot set $M$ if, using $c$ in the above iteration:

$$
|z_i| < \infty \quad \text{for all } i > 0
$$

To compute the Mandelbrot set with the specified parameters, we start by creating a grid of complex numbers using the `numpy` library. Next, we create a boolean `mask` variable indicating which points are in the set. To compute the values in the Mandelbrot set, we use the above iteration.  

We modify the iteration to update the value of $z_{ij}$ only if:

$$
|z_{ij}| < \text{threshold}
$$

After computing the values inside the Mandelbrot set, we can plot an image of the Mandelbrot fractal using `matplotlib`.

## Markov Chains

A Markov transition chain transition matrix $P$ has a set of $n$ states, where $p_{ij}$ is the probability, $0 \leq P_{ij} \leq 1$, of going from state $i$ to state $j$. Each row is normalized so that:

$$
\sum_{j=1}^{n} P_{ij} = 1
$$

In this section, we create a Python script that works with 5 states.

### Task 1: Constructing Random 5x5 Matrix with Normalized Rows

We use `numpy` to generate a random 5x5 matrix. Then, we normalize each row so that:

$$
\sum_{j=1}^{5} p_{ij} = 1
$$

### Task 2: Constructing a Random Normalized Size-5 Vector $p$

We construct a random size-5 vector $p$ and normalize it so that:

$$
\sum_{j=1}^{5} p_{j} = 1
$$


After creating this initial probability vector $p$, we apply the transition rule 50 times to obtain $p_{50}$.

### Task 3: Obtaining the Stationary Distribution

To obtain the stationary distribution, we compute the eigenvector $v$ of $P^T$ corresponding to the eigenvalue 1 and scale it so that:

$$
\sum_{j=1}^{5} v_j = 1
$$

### Task 4: Computing Component-Wise Difference Between $p_{50}$ and the Stationary Distribution

We check to see if $p_{50}$ matches the stationary distribution. In theory, they should be very similar if 50 iterations is enough.

$p_{50}$ and the stationary distribution match within tolerance $10^{-5}$.

## Taylor Series Approximation

For a function $f$ that is infinitely differentiable, its Taylor Series around a point $c$ is:

$$
\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{f^{(n)}(c)}{n!} (x - c)^n 
= f(c) + f'(c)(x - c) + \frac{f''(c)}{2}(x - c)^2 + \frac{f'''(c)}{3!}(x - c)^3 + \cdots
$$

We can approximate a function using the truncated series:

$$
f(x) \approx \sum_{n=0}^{m} \frac{f^{(n)}(c)}{n!} (x - c)^n
$$

### Task 1: Writing a Function That Can Approximate a Function Using Taylor Series

The function takes the following inputs:

- `func`: function to approximate  
- `start`: beginning of the interval  
- `end`: end of the interval  
- `degree`: last integer to truncate the series  
- `fixed_c`: the point $c$ around which we expand  

It outputs a NumPy array representing the approximation of $f$ over the interval. Each term of the series is computed using symbolic derivatives and summed iteratively.

### Task 2: Testing the Function with Specified Parameters

We test the function with:

- $f(x) = x \sin^2(x) + \cos(x)$  
- Numerical domain: [-10, 10] with 100 points  
- Total of 100 terms in the series  
- Expand around $c = 0$  

We use a solid line for the actual function and a red dotted line for the approximation.

### Task 3: Modifying the Function to Measure Error and Elapsed Time for Different Degrees

We add the following inputs:

- initial degree  
- final degree  
- degree step  

For example, using 50 as initial, 100 as final, and 10 as the step, the function computes absolute error and elapsed time for degrees 50, 60, 70, â€¦, 100.

![Results of the function for initial degree = 50, final degree = 100, degree step = 10](taylor_table.png)

Higher polynomial degrees increase accuracy but also computation time. A degree of 100 is more accurate but takes roughly twice as long as a degree of 50.
